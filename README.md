## Tools Used

This project uses the TensorFlow and Keras libraries in Python to implement deep reinforcement learning and to solve the pathfinding problem.


## Artificial Intelligence Explanation
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and natural language processing. AI systems are designed to learn and improve over time by using algorithms that allow them to recognize patterns in data and make predictions based on that data.

There are several types of AI systems, including:

Rule-based systems - These systems are based on a set of rules and are programmed to follow those rules to make decisions.

Machine learning - These systems use algorithms to learn from data and improve their performance over time.

Deep learning - This is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks to learn and recognize patterns in data.

AI has many applications, including in healthcare, finance, transportation, and customer service. For example, AI can be used to diagnose diseases, analyze financial data, drive cars, and provide personalized recommendations to customers.

#Course Work Questions

The code was developed with integration of reinforcement learning algorithm. The game has the ability to use the loop of Keras and Tensorflow to achieve the solution. I was provided with the setup code which include GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py.

THe problem solving mindset drived me throughout the course and I was able to utilize the resources provided in the course as well as various external web sources to develop the working code to solve the problem.

The ethical concerns with AI are :

Bias and discrimination - AI systems can inherit and amplify biases present in the data they are trained on, which can lead to discrimination against certain groups of people. This can have serious consequences, such as perpetuating social inequalities or denying opportunities to certain groups.

Privacy and surveillance - AI systems can collect and analyze vast amounts of personal data, which raises concerns about how this data is being used and protected. There is also a risk that AI could be used for mass surveillance or to infringe on people's privacy rights.

Accountability and transparency - AI systems can be complex and difficult to understand, which makes it challenging to hold them accountable for their actions. There is also a need for transparency in how AI systems are developed, trained, and deployed.
